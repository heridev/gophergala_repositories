/*
Package view is responsible for the UI of the game.
This can be thought of as the View part of an MVC architecture.

The UI is a thin HTML layer, it contains an HTML page with some embedded JavaScript.
No external JavaScript libraries are used, everything is "self-made".

The net/http package is used to serve the HTTP clients (browsers).
