# About Application
<p>
OndeDayOfEarth.com is a Web application where you can just type a City name and see what is happened(happening) in that city using Social Websites API's by location from Instagram Photos, Flickr Photos, Youtube videos, Twitter posts.
</p>
<p>
<b>The core idea is to provide information and news about specific city from people to people, because the news websites and TV channels not giving all true information.</b><br/>
For example on the last year US news channels and websites are talking about Ukraine crisis from one position, Russians from other, but as a 3rd person you need to know what is exactly happening in that particular place. That's why I got an idea of creating some application where people could get full information about what is happening in that particular place within 1 day.

This app will be very useful also people who wants to go Paris for example, and wants to know what's happening there, what people is talking about etc...

# Program Stage
<p>
It seems that 48 hours of GopheraGala is less to finish this web application fully, but I've done backend using Go language with Cron tasks and Rest API webserever. Also some small frontent mockup.
