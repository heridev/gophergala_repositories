The C6100 was a 2U 4-server "cloud-dense" device, sort of like a 2U 
blade chassis.  I've considered getting one, but I'm not sure if I could 
stand the reported noise.  IIRC they have two power supplies per chassis 
and the blades are individually removable, so that may or may not meet 
your definition of redundancy.  It looks like the C6220-II is the 
current model, but I haven't looked at those since they're not cheap on 
ebay.
