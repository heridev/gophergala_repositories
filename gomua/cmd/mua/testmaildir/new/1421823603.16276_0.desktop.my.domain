https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/ and without some
relevance to OpenBSD, this message doesn't belong on this list. In the
event that DigitalOcean does someday offer something relevant to this list,
like OpenBSD hosting, it would be a shame if they'd alienated this
potential market with spam. I'd like to never see DigitalOcean discussed on
misc@ again, while they have no OpenBSD offerings.
