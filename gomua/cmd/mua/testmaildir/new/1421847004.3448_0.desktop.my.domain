Hi Alan,

some time ago I've had a look at them.

Supermicro still seem to have 1U Twin-Server in their List.
Unfortunately I can't say anything about running them - they are still
on my "wishlist".

On the other hand - does anybody know alternatives ? Just in case of not
ending up in some kind of vendor-lock-in issue.

For "weaker" hardware I've allready tested the APU-Boards in a 1U
Dual-Box. I was able to push ~750 Mbps through them with pf enabled
(just the default rules)

  Workstation ---> APU 1 ---> APU 2

just with a simple iperf test.

Also when using ipsec in this test-setup, iperf was able to push ~60Mbps
through the tunnel (ase-128).


Best regards,
Marco
