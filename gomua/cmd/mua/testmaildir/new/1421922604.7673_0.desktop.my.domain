Yes Supermicro twin power supply is shared, but it is redundant, so you need both power supply to fail to have both FW failing (one power supply can power both systems).

>Nice :) Even if the FW were only sharing the same case the idea is dumb because you will have to take off line good FW to fix the one which failed. 

You can remove a system "hot-swap" without affecting the other one. Only a problem if you cannot remove *only* the failing system due to cabling or other mechanical issue.

The only single point of failure I can think of is the backplane connecting everything together (both systems, both power supplies and interconnection to the front panel).
