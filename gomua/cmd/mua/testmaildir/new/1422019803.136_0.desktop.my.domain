Superb teaching Fred!

He came backpacked with 5 OpenBSD devices networked, which the live
streaming of internet music survived the furious battle-axe attack!

Like the capital city of Edinburgh, the Glasgow group has free use of a
hackerspace, with broadband & projector.

The BBC were live broadcasting from another room in the venue, but I
reckon Fred's show would've gotten better ratings.

After Fred's 2 dramatic networking demos, he performed an upgrade on an
Alix firewall.

Ace!
