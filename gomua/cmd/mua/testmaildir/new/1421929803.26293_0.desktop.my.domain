So when the power supply fails you will have both FW down not just one.
Nice :) Even if the FW were only sharing the same case the idea is dumb because you will have to take off line good FW to fix the one which failed. 

Now somebody posted the link to pfSense hardware where each individual FW is removable. That would seems like the solution which fits the bill perfectly and doesn't suffer the problem I just pointed out. However catch 22 is that the case has a non-standard width so you will have to adjust your rack :)
