Now that you mention it, yeah, that command does tell the temperature and such.

Right now:

hw.sensors.acpitz0.temp0=38.50 degC (zone temperature)
hw.sensors.lm1.temp0=21.00 degC
hw.sensors.lm1.temp1=38.50 degC
hw.sensors.lm1.fan0=3668 RPM
hw.sensors.lm1.fan1=2596 RPM
hw.sensors.lm1.volt0=1.55 VDC (VCore)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt1=3.31 VDC (+3.3V)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt2=5.03 VDC (+5V)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt3=11.61 VDC (+12V)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt4=-11.87 VDC (-12V)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt5=-4.80 VDC (-5V)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt6=4.87 VDC (5VSB)
hw.sensors.lm1.volt7=3.30 VDC (VBAT)

To my eye, that all looks withing range. I'll have to try replicating
the load and checking the temperature. (I had google mail, a wikipedia
page or two open and some candy-making pages for my wife, but that was
all at the time. All browser stuff. I was thinking less about load and
more about firefox dying and taking the system with it. Firefox 26.0
from the openbsd 5.5 packages. Google even keeps telling me the
browser is no longer supported by them. Need to upgrade to obsd 5.6
this weekend if I can make the time.)

I think it's getting close to time for spring cleaning with the vacuum
cleaner. Dust is definitely a possibility.

Be careful when you look at conspiracy.
Look first in your own heart,
and ask yourself if you are not your own worst enemy.
Arm yourself with knowledge of yourself, as well.
