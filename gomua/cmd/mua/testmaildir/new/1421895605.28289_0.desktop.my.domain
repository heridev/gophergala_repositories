So when the power supply fails you will have both FW down not just one.
Nice :) Even if the FW were only sharing the same case the idea is dumb
because you will have to take off line good FW to fix the one which
failed. 

Now somebody posted the link to pfSense hardware where each individual
FW is removable. That would seems like the solution which fits the bill
perfectly and doesn't suffer the problem I just pointed out. However
catch 22 is that the case has a non-standard width so you will have to
adjust your rack :)
