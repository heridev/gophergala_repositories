I've personally had problems with OpenBSD panics with softupdates when 
running under ESXi when the back-end storage becomes high-latency 
(aggressive SAN backups, not enough spindles).  I haven't tried recently 
(it was difficult to repro on demand) but I didn't really consider it an 
OpenBSD issue.  Presumably softupdate has shorter timeouts.
