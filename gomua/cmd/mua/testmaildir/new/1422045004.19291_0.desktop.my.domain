I was following this discussion with the great interest but without
intend to participate in it until today.

Namely one of my OpenBSD servers (5.6 sparc64) runs Mollify and last
night I received an e-mail from an angry user who could not upload files
(the upload will fail or upload the file with file size zero). After
running df I noticed that /tmp was 100% full (4GB used) but the size of
individual files was only 12Kb. I thought for a second and I remember
seeing this with HAMMER on DF. Long story short I checked /etc/fstab and
sure enough I had rw,softdep next to each partition including tmp. I
removed softdep rebooted the sytem and /tmp usage dropped to 0%. More
importantly users could upload files again.

My questions is which partitions should be mounted with softdep option?
Is there a way to prune metadata which will save me for problems like
the one I encountered last night.

Best,
Predrag
