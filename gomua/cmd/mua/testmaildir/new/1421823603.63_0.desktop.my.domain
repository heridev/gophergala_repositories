DigitalOcean is a shady provider with a lack of documentation, who
doesn't even give you IPv6 address space across their fleet, or in
those few locations they do, they do it in violation of all known RFCs
and the best practices -- I've heard a rumour that they only give out
16 IPv6 addresses.  Why a rumour?  Because, as already mentioned, they
completely lack the documentation!

I don't know why you would want to run OpenBSD on it.  If you're just
in it for the "OpenBSD" part, just go with real hardware like
online.net -- they start at 5,99 EUR/mo, there's not much reason to
have to rent a virtual server if dedi is that cheap.

Lots of other dedi options at http://lowendcore.com/.

With dedi prices that low, virtual hosting for OpenBSD is kinda dead, IMHO.
