Or you can just use any cheap KVM-based VPS provider that allows you to upload ISOs.

DigitalOcean is a shady provider with a lack of documentation, who doesn't even give you IPv6 address space across their fleet, or in those few locations they do, they do it in violation of all known RFCs and the best practices -- I've heard a rumour that they only give out
16 IPv6 addresses.  Why a rumour?  Because, as already mentioned, they completely lack the documentation!

I don't know why you would want to run OpenBSD on it.  If you're just in it for the "OpenBSD" part, just go with real hardware like online.net -- they start at 5,99 EUR/mo, there's not much reason to have to rent a virtual server if dedi is that cheap.

Lots of other dedi options at http://lowendcore.com/.

With dedi prices that low, virtual hosting for OpenBSD is kinda dead, IMHO.
