I'm guessing you want to use your phone as a hotspot for openBSD.
So you turn on the hotspot feature in the phone an IT ACTS like a router and
DHCP server, and it usually (if you are wise) is set up to use wpa2 (aes) security.

Then you will need a file named hostname.ath0 (the last part will vary with the
name of your wifi card) in the /etc directory.  attrs: 640

in that file you have something like

nwid (name-of-your-phone-accesspoint)
wpakey (your wifi access point password
dhcp

Then it just seems to work automatically.
