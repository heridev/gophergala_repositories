I'm running a pair of redundant OpenBSD firewalls/routers on C6100 
blades.  I can confirm, having had to strip and repair one of mine, that 
the only shared components common to all 4 slots are:
     1. The metal shell
     2. The fan control board
     3. the SATA backplane, at least physically.

The backplane the blades plug into is split into (independent) top and 
bottom halves.
The power distribution/sharing system is split into (1+1 redundant, 
connected) top and bottom halves.
The SATA backplane, although shared, appears to be 99% passive and 
signal traces appear to be highly localized; power is another story for 
obvious reasons; a catastrophic failure in one SATA drive could 
propagate to other drives, but would be fused at the power distribution 
board(s).

It's inaccurate to characterize the 4 servers in a C6100 chassis as 
**completely** indepedent, but I can confirm that you definitely can 
pull and replace individual blades without affecting the others.
In my case, I have enough 6 other servers running at that site, so I can 
put one router in each chassis, thus ensuring complete separation all 
the way out to the ethernet switch and/or the shared UPS (take your pick).
