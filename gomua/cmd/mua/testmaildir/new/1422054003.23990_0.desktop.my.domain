Now it seems obvious that I made a mistake and put the blame on metadata
instead of running fstat but at the moment I had a mindset of DF user.
Namely couple of months ago I had a rogue process which keeps altering
log files on one of DF machines. Long story short after couple of hours
my /var had only about 1GB of log files but HAMMER history almost
completely filled the rest of /var due to the frequent changes of log
files. I regained the space by clearing HAMMER history and learned how
to tune HAMMER retention parameters.

It seems from what you are saying and from what seems clear to me before
last night incident that I made a fundamental mistake of thinking of
soft updates as honest journaling file system while in reality they are
just a way of maintaining file system meta-data integrity. Hence softdep
are safe from HAMMER like history retention problems.

Most Kind Regards,
Predrag

P.S. Since you are developer I can't resist not to ask if anybody is
looking at Bitrig code which brings WAPBL essentially into OpenBSD?
