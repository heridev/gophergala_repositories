While I don't really recommend them, the older Nokia IP260 was a 1U half 
rack wide appliance. Nokia made a frame that held 2 of them in a 1U 
standard 19 inch rack space. OpenBSD will run on them, but it requires a 
little effort to get it to work.  Or it did the last time I tried it. My 
efforts to get OpenBSD to work on them is either in the archives of this 
list or tech@. The current CheckPoint 2200 series is of similar width 
and not as deep as the IP260. I don't know if they offer a mounting 
plate to rack 2 side by side. We either sit them on top of something in 
the rack or install a shelf in the rack. I've yet to try OpenBSD on one 
though.  If we have a spare 2207 at work, I'll see if OpenBSD will run 
on it.
