That is unlikely to be due to softdep.  The usual reason for a file
system to be actually full and seemingly almost empty at the same
time is somebody doing the following sequence of operations:

 - open(2) a file for writing
 - writing a lot of data until the file system is full
 - unlink(2) the file
 - keep the process running that open(2)'ed it
 - let that process keep the file open and *not* close(2) it

Specifically, in /tmp, anybody can do that.

The above works with almost any file system.

That's not likely to be related to softdep either.  Chances are
just rebooting would have solved the issue as well - simply because
rebooting terminates all running processes, and consequently closes
all open files.

What you should have done instead was run fstat(1), look for processes
having files open in /tmp, use ls(1) -iRa /tmp to find the inode
numbers of linked files in /tmp, and kill the processes having files
open that were *not* linked until you found the one having the big
file open - and then have a friendly talk with the responsible user,
if any, or figure out what went wrong in case some daemon process
caused the issue.

I'm not an expert on that and hardly ever use softdep, but i'd say
on file systems where file create/delete performance is *critically*
important, performace has been clearly demonstrated to be insufficient
without softdep, and you consider data loss harmless.

I'm not convinced that's a good question to ask.

Yours,
