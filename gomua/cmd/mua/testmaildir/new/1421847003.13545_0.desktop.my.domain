Keep in mind what softdeps do -- they improve performance of disk
writes.  They do nothing for disk reads.  Write a few small files, you
won't see much.  Write lots of files, you will see a huge difference.

Firefox is just plain slow at everything it seems, but writes are not
the major bottleneck, so you may not see much gain.

If you want to see a huge difference in softdep performance, unpack a
tar file with a lot of small files, such as the ports or source files.
No stopwatch will be needed to see the difference.

Nick.
