Two things: UNIX servers like OpenBSD usually clean /tmp every reboot:

$ ls -la /tmp
total 20
drwxrwxrwt   5 root  wheel  512 Jan 23 15:00 .
drwxr-xr-x  16 root  wheel  512 Jan 23 14:58 ..
drwxrwxrwt   2 root  wheel  512 Jan 23 15:00 .ICE-unix
drwxrwxrwt   2 root  wheel  512 Jan 23 15:00 .X11-unix
drwxr-xr-x   2 root  wheel  512 Jan 23 15:00 aucat
$ uptime
  3:00PM  up 1 min, 1 user, load averages: 1.11, 0.41, 0.16

And one thing is space available and other different but related is  
inodes available:

$ df -i /tmp
Filesystem  512-blocks      Used     Avail Capacity iused   ifree   
%iused  Mounted on
/dev/wd0a      1920764    126340   1698388     7%    2439  127479     2%   /

If you have lots of small files you might have plenty of space  
available, but will be unable to create more files if there are no  
inodes available.
