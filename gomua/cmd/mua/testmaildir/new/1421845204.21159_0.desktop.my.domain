I might be quick on judgement or even mess with thread's topic, but
did you reported that problem anywere close to openbsd project lists?
SSD is a very used hardware under OpenBSD, it is not so exotic. I
think that are developers who can take a look at your problem if you
report it.

After watching this thread, I enabled softdep on all FFS partitions
thinking that Firefox will speed up a bit. I will see the results in
time.
