goathtool incompletely reproduces the functionality of nongnu.org's oathtool
<http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/man-oathtool.html>. How incompletely is to
be determined. The intent is to implement the functionality the primary author
uses most and then -- as time or PRs occur -- to fill in more of the features.
The author also intends to differ in implementation of defaults and invocation.

Examples

TODO: do examples and more docs.
