## tbd
### a #tag-based dependency tool for low ceremony task tracking

#### [presentation](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/gophergala/tbd/tbd.slide#1)

#### [further development will only happen at this repo](https://github.com/solarsea/tbd)

#### In order to use:

* Keep your tasks in a text file named 'tbdata', one task per line
* Tag your tasks with #some #tags to indicate dependencies

#### Invoke tbd

* without any arguments to list all non-blocked tasks
* with tag names to list all partially matching tasks

Live, learn and take it easy :)
