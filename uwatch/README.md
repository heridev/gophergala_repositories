# UWatch

### Story

I often receive URLs to funny YouTube videos from colleagues and friends. If I click on one of those, YouTube starts playing it automatically. Before doing so, I'd like to see the context (ie. title) and decide if I really have to watch it or should set it aside.

### Goal

UWatch is descriptive link generator for streaming video sites (eg. YouTube). The main goal of the project is to assist users in sharing human-readable link.

### Example

Standard URLs don't hold any information about the content:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGdFHJXciAQ

Long URLs created with UWatch put videos to be shared into context:

### Future improvement

* Support more video sharing sites like Vimeo, Youku, Rutube, etc.
* List most popular videos on the landing page
