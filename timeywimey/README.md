What is this?
-------------

Simply put this was a project to be done during the [Gopher Gala](http://gophergala.com/) in which we
have 48 hours to create something using the [Go](http://golang.org/) language.

The scope of this project was to play with the idea of demonstrating how everything is related via the perspective
of a timeline. To make the point we are going to incorporate everyday items such as work issues, changesets,
meetings, invoices and payments, and possibly other work related items in to one perspective. Honestly, it would
be best if we just incorporated a bunch of webhooks for existing systems and then just incorporate them in to
a single calendar view, but might as well be ambitious, eh?
