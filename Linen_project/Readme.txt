Objective: simple parse / compare
Read a dictionary file.
Read a text file.
Compare the text to the dictionary and count how many times each word in the dictionary appears in the text 
and how many words in the text not found in the dictionary

step 1: 
confirm that a file can be read and displayed (done!)

step 2:
write a simple compare function that reads in a text file, and prints out delimited words

step 3: 
read in text file and compare it to two words (using a switch statement) and prints out those words if it sees them

step 3: 
instead of printing the words, print the words to compare once with a count of how many times they appear in the text

step 4:
instead of reading in whole words, read them in letter by letter

step 5: 
instead of comparing whole words, compare them letter by letter

step: 6
Use a trie data structure to create the dictionary
Read in each part of the text, comparing to trie and counting number of occurrences
print out counts

room for more steps here if we get to them!  :-)
