		<h1>Details of the Chess websocket requests</h1>
		<P>NOTE: Because we're using websockets, every write is made to an open socket - ie a single url, etc.
			To differentiate between the different types of requests and responses, a "type" field is mandated with 
			all requests and responses describing the different requests and responses</p>
		<p>Also observe that as this is a websocket connection, requests and responses can be considered asynchronous: if for instance game_move is requested,
			don't assume the next message will contain game_move_update!</p>
		<p>To begin with, clients will connect to a websocket at an arbitrary address</p>
		<p>Then, they will attempt to authenticate:</p>
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>client sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "authentication_request",
	"username": "some-username",
	"user_token": "some-access-token"
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		To which the server will respond
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "authentication_response",
	"response":"ok" 					[Anything else implies rejection]
	"user": {
		"user_id": some-intID,
		"username": "some-username",
		"created_at": "some-date-time",
		"current_rank": "some-rank",
		"is_ai": false,					[Whether or not this account is an AI]
		"verses_ai": true				[Whether or not this account is happy to verse AI]
	}
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		Time will pass, and server will send a request like so: (remember, clients don't get to pick a game, the server will attempt to pick one for them)
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_request",
	"opponent": {
		"user_id": some-intID,
		"username": "some-username",
		"created_at": "some-date-time",
		"current_rank": "some-rank",
		"is_ai": false,
		"verses_ai": true
	}
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		A short time passes - user has only 15 seconds to press the approve button or server will assume rejection<br>
		If not, user can send this response:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>client sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_response",
	"response": "ok" 					[Anything else implies rejection]
}
Game_id field is not required as the server will know which game it has asked this client to approve
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		If they were rejected (ie they took too long) they will be sent this
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_response_rejection",
	"response": "rejected" 					[Anything can be here]
}
Game_id field is not required as the server will know which game it has asked this client to approve
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		At this point, the game will be created on the server and clients can assume they have been joined to a game automatically.<br>
		The server will send the following data to both teams only changing the "white" and "your_move" fields:<br>
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends (to both, perspective of black team)</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_move_update",
	"game": {
		"id": some-intID,
		"created_at": "some-date-time",
		"finished_at": "some-date-time",
		"game_status": "",					[will be empty until game over]
		"board_status": {					
			[array for board status of game]
		},
		"game_moves": [							[empty cos first move]

		],
		"white": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,				[the person who's move it is can be extrapolated from ]
			"username": "some-username",
			"created_at": "some-date-time",
			"current_rank": "some-rank",		
			"is_ai": false,
			"verses_ai": true
		}
		"black": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"username": "some-username",
			"created_at": "some-date-time",
			"current_rank": "some-rank",		
			"is_ai": false,
			"verses_ai": true
		}
	}
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		The white client might respond as so:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>client (white) sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_move_request"
	"move": "e2-e4"						[has moved a pawn from e2 to e4]
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		To which the server will send to both teams:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends (to both, perspective of black team)</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_move_update",
	"game": {
		"id": some-intID,
		"created_at": "some-date-time",
		"finished_at": "some-date-time",
		"game_status": "victory",					[can be stalemate or disconnection]
		"board_status": {					
			[array for board status of game]
		},
		"game_moves": [							[move has been added to array]
			{	
				"move": "e2-e4",
				"created_at": "some-date-time",
				"id": some-intID
			},
		],
		"white": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"username": "some-username",
			"created_at": "some-date-time",
			"current_rank": "some-rank",		
			"is_ai": false,
			"verses_ai": true
		}
		"black": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"username": "some-username",
			"created_at": "some-date-time",
			"current_rank": "some-rank",		
			"is_ai": false,
			"verses_ai": true
		},
	}
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		The game continues for a while all the time players making valid moves, and eventually it will finish:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends to both</h4>
				<pre>
server notifies (both clients)
{
	"type": "game_over",
	"game": {
		"id": some-intID,
		"created_at": "some-date-time",
		"finished_at": "some-date-time",
		"game_status": "victory",					[could also be stalemate or disconnection]
		"board_status": {					
			[array for board status of game]
		},
		"game_moves": [
			{	
				"move": "e2-e4",
				"created_at": "some-date-time",
				"id": some-intID
			},
			...
		],
		"white": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"username": "some-username",
			"created_at": "some-date-time",
			"current_rank": "some-rank",		
			"is_ai": false,
			"verses_ai": true
		}
		"black": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"username": "some-username",
			"created_at": "some-date-time",
			"current_rank": "some-rank",		
			"is_ai": false,
			"verses_ai": true
		},
		"winner": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"rank_change": some_integer,		
		},
		"loser": {						
			"user_id": some-intID,
			"rank_change": some_integer,		
		},
	}

}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		And hence, both players are moved back to the waiting for a game.
		<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>
		In addition, any time during a game, players can send a pre-defined chat message (think AOE or old online hearts style)
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>Client sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_chat_request",
	"message_id": 1
}

The official messages are as follows:
1. Hello
2. I am the King.
3. You took my piece!
4. Bishop! I need a bishop!
5. I didn't like that Knight anyway...
6. :)
7. :(
8. D:
9. :D
10. I'm gonna get you back for that.
11. You sunk my battleship...
12. Prepare for defeat!
13. Nicely done.
14. This isn't a game, this is a slaughter!
15. Don't worry be happy :-)
16. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!

				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		And as such, server responds:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends to both</h4>
				<pre>

	"type": "game_chat",

				<pre>
player sends

		<h3>Finally, how do we register?</h3>
		Before authentication (signing in) players may attempt to register a new account through the following websocket API:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>client sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "signup_request",
	"username": "some-username",
	"user_token": "some-access-token",
	"is_ai": false,
	"verses_ai": true
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		To which the server will respond (and this also signs them in)
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "signup_response",
	"response":"ok" 					[Anything else implies rejection]
	"user": {
		"user_id": some-intID,
		"username": "some-username",
		"created_at": "some-date-time",
		"current_rank": "some-rank",
		"is_ai": false,
		"verses_ai": true
	}
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		Players can request a list of valid moves:
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>client sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_get_valid_moves_request"
	"location": "e2"						[the square you're interested in]
}
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		To which the server will respond (and this also signs them in)
		<div class='endpoint'>
			<div class='code'>
				<h4>server sends</h4>
				<pre>
{
	"type": "game_get_valid_moves_response",
	"moves": [
