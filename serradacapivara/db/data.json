		"Description": "The Toca do Boqueirao da Pedra Furada is 19 meters above the level of the valley, protected by large blocks originating from the collapse of the rock wall. Its formation is due, as in all sites in the region, erosion the base of the wall, forming a projection that serves as a ceiling. The process of formation of the archaeological layers of this site lasted at least 60,000 years. The excavations, which began in 1978, lasted 10 years and led to the discovery of the oldest remains, to this day known, the human presence in the Americas: structured fires and a lot of chipped stone artifacts. Building blocks with paintings, fallen on the archaeological layers, allowed the dating of the same. The oldest traces are two red spots dated 23,000 years, two parallel segments of straight dating back 17,000 years, while paintings of similar subjects to those who remain today the walls were painted between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago. This site was possible to reconstruct the history of human occupation for nearly 60,000 years to 6,000 years ago. (http://wwww.fumdham.org.br) ",
