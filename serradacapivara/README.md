## Serra da Capivara ##

This is a website that is a showcase of all the archeological sites in the region of Serra da Capivara Park. It is built in golang for the gophergala competition.

For some time we did not know what really we want to do, The only thing we known was that we wanted to make something with google maps and Serra da Capivara. At the end it is a very simple website and it not show the potential of the golang.

There is thousands of sites in the Serra da Capivara Park. For this app we added only five sites (Many sites does not have geolocation available online.)

These application helped me to introduce the golang to my colleagues, that before this competition they known nothing about golang.

As dependency it uses only the goji tookit, that we decided to use only because we heard a lot of good things about it.
